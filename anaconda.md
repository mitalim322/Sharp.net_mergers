# **Anaconda Installation Procedure**

* Visit the Anaconda download page [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads)
* Select MacOS/Linux/Windows fromm the operating systems box and download the .pkg installer
_(here I am using MacOS)_
* Go to the downloads folder in **Finder** and double click on the .pkg installer file.
* Now follow the installation instructions as given by the installer
_(Hence Anaconda is now installed in our device)_
---
* Now to check whether it is installed or not open **terminal/command prompt** on your device
* Type **"python"** 
* It shows some version of it _(which shows that python is there)
* Type **"conda --version"** to see it's version which has been just installed by you. _(it should be the latest version)_

So that was the entire procedure to install **Anaconda**
